In this repo I'll be posting write-ups to solve the levels of the popular
ssh based wargame Bandit, avaiable at https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/

The game can be accessed via SSH at ssh://bandit.labs.overthewire.org on port
2220. For each writeup I will be censoring the actual password required to
goto to the next level, the way I solved the levels and the commands I used
will be posted publically though.

While solving this game even I had to look up parts of solutions to a few
levels online, I will be giving credit where due.

Thanks!
